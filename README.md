# React Native FlatList Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders a blank screen even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue arises from improper state management or asynchronous operations. The solution involves careful error handling and ensuring data is properly loaded before rendering the FlatList.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches data from a remote API. While the API call succeeds, the FlatList remains blank, giving no visual feedback of the fetched data. There are no console errors, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

The solution in `DataFetchSolution.js` addresses this by explicitly handling loading states and errors, providing visual feedback to the user during these phases. It also employs more robust error checking for the API response and uses the correct keyExtractor in the Flatlist component.  This ensures the FlatList only renders once the data is available and provides user-friendly error messages when problems occur.
